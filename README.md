# rollbucks

rollbucks aims to facilitate African talents in receiving payments from companies worldwide.

location is a huge barrier to getting jobs internationally -- it's not easy to navigate tax laws and local payment methods. 
 
we solve this by offering payment solutions for freelancers and enables companies to easily pay their employees across different regions.

we aim to streamline the payment process for African talents by providing:

- **Freelancer Payments:** Facilitating payments for freelancers working with companies globally.
- **Company Payroll Solutions:** Offering a system for companies to efficiently pay their employees, irrespective of their location.
- **Simplified Transactions:** Offering a straightforward payment process for freelancers and companies.
- **Cross-Border Payments:** Enabling hassle-free transactions across different regions.
